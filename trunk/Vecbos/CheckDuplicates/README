=== What is this ===

- This is a set a scripts aiming at a semi-automatic way to check if
there are any duplicate events in a given set of root files, and the
root files are in format of usual vecbos lists

- The script launches one job per run (which might be a lot of files),
and count the number of times an event is appearing; then fill the
result in a histogram.

- For example if there is a file with 5 events (Run, Event)

124020 13523853
124020 13523854
124020 13523855
124020 13523855
124020 13523856

then the 1-count bin will be 3, and the 2-count bin will be 1.

- The output is a pdf file for easy viewing




=== Do only once to setup ===

1. To checkout this code, on lxplus, do

svn checkout http://fheadhelpercode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Vecbos/CheckDuplicates VecbosCheckDuplicates

which will give you a skeleton structure with minimal script


2. After checking out, you should modify MakeSingleRunList.py and set the
CMSSW area to the right one


3. Compile CheckDuplicates.C by going into a root session and do

[0] .L CheckDuplicates.C+
[1] .q

Note: try to use the same CMSSW version as you will submit the jobs for
smoother experience




=== Do every time new data comes ===

4. Now, every time there is a new set of data coming and you would like
to check for duplicates, first prepare the list in usual vecbos list
format (ie., like one of those in the cmst3_35X/... folders)


5. Run the script to prepare scripts for submitting

sh PrepareToRun.sh (ListLocation) (TagName)

where the first argument is the list file, and the second one is some
tag in order not to overwrite previous result


6. Now the scripts should be in SingleRunScripts and the single-run lists
should be in SingleRunLists.  Go to SingleRunScripts folder and submit
the ones you want, or submit all by doing

sh SubmitAll.sh

which will submit all single-run scripts to queue <8nh> on lxplus.


7. Wait until they all finish, and then go to Processing folder.


8. Run the script that adds and exports stuff (for everything)

sh AddAll.sh


9. There should be a pdf file containing all the histograms for different
runs.  Check if there is everything is in bin with 1.  If not, there
are duplicates in the run.


=== Note ===

- I might include an update on SubmitAll.sh to be tag-specific....if I
got time to do it.
